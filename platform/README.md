# Platform (Portfolio Project)

This folder is the evolving “production-style” project built from the Zoomcamp modules.
Modules 01–03 remain intact for homework submission; this folder will gradually consolidate the best/cleanest implementations into one cohesive platform.

Planned layers:
- infrastructure/  (Terraform, IAM, environments)
- ingestion/       (standardized ingestion jobs)
- orchestration/   (Airflow DAGs)
- warehouse/       (BigQuery SQL models)
- analytics/       (marts, reporting tables)
- docs/            (diagrams, screenshots)
